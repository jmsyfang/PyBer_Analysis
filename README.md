## Overview
We are exploring how rides differ in fare total and rides by city type.

## Results
Urban rides comprise of 86% of all rides, with suburban rides being the majority of the remainder. While rural fares are higher than their counterparts, the total fares collected are significantly less. Suburban rides are approximately 7 times smaller than urban rides but are only half as small in total fares due to the better average fare rates.

## Summary
Rural rides are less common but are a much higher fare than the other city types. If we are looking to promote activity in the rural areas, we should try to provide flat dollar discounts over % discounts to entice riders.
